# `fastmcp.server.dependencies`

## Functions

### `get_context`

```python
get_context() -> Context
```

### `get_http_request`

```python
get_http_request() -> Request
```

### `get_http_headers`

```python
get_http_headers(include_all: bool = False) -> dict[str, str]
```


Extract headers from the current HTTP request if available.

Never raises an exception, even if there is no active HTTP request (in which case
an empty dict is returned).

By default, strips problematic headers like `content-length` that cause issues if forwarded to downstream clients.
If `include_all` is True, all headers are returned.
