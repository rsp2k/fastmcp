# `fastmcp.utilities.components`

## Classes

### `FastMCPComponent`


Base class for FastMCP tools, prompts, resources, and resource templates.


**Methods:**

#### `key`

```python
key(self) -> str
```

The key of the component. This is used for internal bookkeeping
and may reflect e.g. prefixes or other identifiers. You should not depend on
keys having a certain value, as the same tool loaded from different
hierarchies of servers may have different keys.


#### `with_key`

```python
with_key(self, key: str) -> Self
```

#### `enable`

```python
enable(self) -> None
```

Enable the component.


#### `disable`

```python
disable(self) -> None
```

Disable the component.
