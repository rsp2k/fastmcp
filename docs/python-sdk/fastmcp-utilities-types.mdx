# `fastmcp.utilities.types`


Common types used across FastMCP.

## Functions

### `get_cached_typeadapter`

```python
get_cached_typeadapter(cls: T) -> TypeAdapter[T]
```


TypeAdapters are heavy objects, and in an application context we'd typically
create them once in a global scope and reuse them as often as possible.
However, this isn't feasible for user-generated functions. Instead, we use a
cache to minimize the cost of creating them as much as possible.


### `issubclass_safe`

```python
issubclass_safe(cls: type, base: type) -> bool
```


Check if cls is a subclass of base, even if cls is a type variable.


### `is_class_member_of_type`

```python
is_class_member_of_type(cls: type, base: type) -> bool
```


Check if cls is a member of base, even if cls is a type variable.

Base can be a type, a UnionType, or an Annotated type. Generic types are not
considered members (e.g. T is not a member of list\[T]).


### `find_kwarg_by_type`

```python
find_kwarg_by_type(fn: Callable, kwarg_type: type) -> str | None
```


Find the name of the kwarg that is of type kwarg_type.

Includes union types that contain the kwarg_type, as well as Annotated types.


## Classes

### `FastMCPBaseModel`


Base model for FastMCP models.


### `Image`


Helper class for returning images from tools.


**Methods:**

#### `to_image_content`

```python
to_image_content(self, mime_type: str | None = None, annotations: Annotations | None = None) -> ImageContent
```

Convert to MCP ImageContent.


### `Audio`


Helper class for returning audio from tools.


**Methods:**

#### `to_audio_content`

```python
to_audio_content(self, mime_type: str | None = None, annotations: Annotations | None = None) -> AudioContent
```

### `File`


Helper class for returning audio from tools.


**Methods:**

#### `to_resource_content`

```python
to_resource_content(self, mime_type: str | None = None, annotations: Annotations | None = None) -> EmbeddedResource
```
